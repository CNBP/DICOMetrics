Author Yang Ding, dude not sure what he is doing but trying to cobble together some all kinds of image metric method gather for all over the Internet mostly compiled in Matlab. 
The goal of this toolbox is to provide a useful measurefor people to be able to effectively calculate the various forms of metrics such that a statistical distribution of these variable based on image sets can be inferred and quality control can be established based on these parameters. 

Sponsored by Dr. Gregory Lodygensky from St. Justine Hospital as a part of the Canadian neonatal brain platform.
