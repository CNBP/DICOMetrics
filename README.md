@Author Yang Ding, the dude who is not sure what he is doing but trying to cobble together some of image metric methods gather for all over the Internet mostly compiled in Matlab. 

The goal of this script compilation is to provide useful image quantitative measurements for people to be able to effectively train models to combine them so such that a statistical distribution of these variable based on image sets can be inferred and quality control can be established based on these parameters.
