@Author Yang Ding, the dude who is not sure what he is doing but trying to cobble together some all kinds of image metric methods gather for all over the Internet mostly compiled in Matlab. 

The goal of this script mess is to provide useful measures for people to be able to effectively calculate the various forms of metrics such that a statistical distribution of these variable based on image sets can be inferred and quality control can be established based on these parameters.
